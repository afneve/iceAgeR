The name Colsac is the phonetic rendering of the two counties the ferry connects, Columbia and Sauk. The ferry crosses the Wisconsin River at a wider part of the river known as Lake Wisconsin, which is a reservoir produced by a dam downstream. At that spot, it is both the Wisconsin River and Lake Wisconsin. The ferry takes seven minutes to cross approximately 0.45 miles. State-operated, the service is free to all, including cars, bikes and pedestrians, and runs 24 hours, 7 days a week April 15 through November 30. The ferry is closed December 1 through April 14. There is a separate lane for pedestrians and bicycles, boarding from the sidewalk on the east (upriver) side of the ferry.

The Cardy Site, marked by a kiosk and plaque, preserves the remains of a campsite used by Native Americans at the end of the Ice Age. An extensive dig in 2003 unearthed spear points, tools, a fire pit and other artifacts. Archeologists believe that Native Americans lived and worked in this area 11,000 years ago near the shore of Glacial Lake Algonquin and within walking distance of the receding continental ice sheet. This camp is unusual for its far north location. Glacial Lake Algonquin occupied the Lake Michigan and Lake Huron basins at the end of the Ice Age and would have been about 25 feet higher than Green Bay is
